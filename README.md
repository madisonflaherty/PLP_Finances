# PLP_Finances
Practical learning excercise meant for beginner programmers.  

## Step 1

### What you need to know before you can start
- Basic understanding of what a function is and how to use them (parameters and returning values)
- Very basic understanding of classes (essentially that they are "blueprints")
- priliminary understanding of lists in python (empty lists are used)
- Basic Git/Github understanding (check out (Github's Beginner Guide)[check out https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/])

### What you need to do
1. Fork the code into your own repository.
1. Review the provided files (especially account.py and transaction.py)
1. Most of transaction.py is stubbed out (including tests!) consider what is important to a typical bank transaction and update and add accordingly
1. Go back to the account.py file and update the transaction related methods accordingly so that we can add transactions. (Don't forget to update and add to the tests!)

### Testing the code
Simply run the code (with python3 installed) via the command line with ```python3 transaction.py``` or ```python3 account.py```.
